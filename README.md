# Encryption SDKs for JavaScript

[Overview](#overview) · [Identity](#identity-management) · [Contributing](#contributing) · [License](#license)

## Overview

Tanker is an open-source solution to protect sensitive data in any application, with a simple end-user experience and good performance. No cryptographic skills are required to implement it.

## Identity management

End-to-end encryption requires that all users have cryptographic identities. The following packages help to handle them:

Tanker **Identity** is a server side package to link Tanker identities with your users in your application backend.
It is available in multiple languages. This repository only contains the Javascript version.

## Contributing

We welcome feedback, [bug reports](https://github.com/TankerHQ/identity-js/issues), and bug fixes in the form of [pull requests](https://github.com/TankerHQ/identity-js/pulls).

To build the JavaScript SDKs yourself, please follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

Install the lastest version of [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Use this command to check the npm version installed on your system:
```bash
npm --version
```

### Install dependencies

Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TankerHQ/identity-js.git
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
cd identity-js && npm install
```

### Test and lint

Our codebase uses the following ES6 features: `async` / `await`, `import` / `export`, and classes with flow for type-checking and with eslint for linting.

To check that the code is correct and to launch the tests in Node.js, use:

```bash
npm run proof
```

### Submit your pull request

Before submitting your pull request, please make sure that your changes pass the linters and that all the tests pass on your local machine.

For non-trivial changes, we highly recommend including extra tests.
